ABOUT THEME
Notable is a big bold travel blog theme, designed to feature your beautiful travel photos and stories. The home page has an optional posts slider which let's you set up a specific slider category for those posts you want to feature there. On the home page you can also choose to (optionally) feature some static pages right below the slider too. Of course you can set colors, social media links, and logo through the Customizer so you can make it your own without any coding required. Happy trails.
